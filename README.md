# Anti plagiarism python code
---
The simple project that allows you to compare code on Python.
As a result, you get a code similarity score, where 1.0 is the complete similarity.
In the algorithm uses the **Damerau-Levenshtein distance** for determine similarity.

## Introduction
In file **input.txt** must contain paths to code files.
In file **scores.txt** will contain similarity scores.

In The project has code to test the algorithm(files, plagiat1, plagiat2).
